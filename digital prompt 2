Your task is to generate a single, complete, and production-ready HTML file for a Wells Fargo digital banner advertisement. You will be given only a high-level Campaign Brief and Audience Segment. Based on these inputs, you must creatively and professionally determine all other necessary variables (headline, body copy, CTA, banner size, and imagery concept) and then write the full HTML, CSS, and JS code for the banner.

The generated code must be fully compliant with all Wells Fargo brand guidelines, ethical advertising standards, and technical/accessibility (WCAG AA) requirements listed below.

{AUDIENCE_SEGMENT}: A description of the target audience (e.g., "First-time homebuyers," "Small business owners," "College students opening a first checking account").
